# CLPS950-FinalProj

Our code uses PsychoPy to facilitate a color-sorting game. Participants are presented with a shuffled row of 5 rectangular tiles and asked to sort them based on hues. To assist with the sorting, participants are provided with reference tiles on either end of the blank grid that serve as a base for the gradients. Once participants have dragged and dropped the tiles into the appropriate spots, they can click the "Check" button to check their answers. Once clicked, the number of correct answers out of 5 is displayed on the screen. The color sorting game has 4 trials of differing colors and ranges in difficulty.

The code for this game requires several components. First, visual tools using PsychoPy are utilized to draw shapes and text on the screen. Positions were calculated with pixels and colors were drawn using hex values. Second, a drag and drop component was required to be able to choose specific tiles and move them to particular positions on the screen. Third, code that checked for correct answers was required to give participants a score for each trial of the game. All of these components required trial and error, teamwork, and debugging that culminated in coding our final project for the class!
